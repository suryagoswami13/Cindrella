                  about anything to get out of it. So he has Alex dress as himself and go to the
                  ball in a mask- claiming he thought it was going to be a masquerade ball.
                  Meanwhile Cinderella leaves the waiting coach (her step family is attending the ball,
                  of course) and goes to the gardens to watch. While there, Cinderella meets Nicholas,
                  a violinist in love with a noble's daughter, Lora Pennington. Despite their love for
                  each other, Nicholas and Lora are forbidden by her parents to be married because he
                  is a commoner and they have hopes of marrying their daughter to Prince Charles. This
                  is why the violinist's music is so sad. Charles and Cinderella talk a bit about this
                  when they see each other in the gardens and both agree that things like wealth and nobility
                  shouldn't dictate who you marry. They also both agree that in the end, true love can conquer over any obstacle.

                  Refusing to be seen at the ball with her, they tear her invitation. After hoping for so long to see Charles again and wish him the best of

                  Cinderella leaves the ball at the stroke of midnight in a rush, leaving her glass slipper behind her.

                  Cinderella as hostage and threatens to push her off the castle wall if the King refuses to give Zarel the throne. At the Last
                  moment, Prince Charles comes in, declaring that he never drank the poison. Prince Charles chases Zarel to the top of the Castle
                  Tower and fights Zarel, who pushes Cinderella off the tower. Cinderella holds on to the edge of the tower for dear life. Zarel
                  takes a swing at her with his sword, Cinderella losing her grip just at the moment his sword is about to hit her and Zarel's sword
                  hits the stone. Cinderella Falls, and Prince Charles catches her. When Zarel's sword hit the stone, pieces of the stone hit him in
                  the eyes, causing him to be unable to see. He stumbles off the clock tower and falls to his death. The episode ends with Prince Charles
                  being crowned King and Cinderella being crowned Queen with all her family and friends in attendance.
